### The simulation of the Sensitivity phantom for the calculation of the scanner's sensitivity. 

There are five simulations; each folder have one simulation of different attenuation phantom. The 'Biograph_16_GPU_SEN1' have no Al sleeve.

## Run
Run 'run.sh' file in "Shell" to start the simulation. The simulation will run one by one to save the memory.

# The code for GATE simualtion

## RUN MODE
'CPU'	: the sources are 18-F, and no voxelized pahntom and source. The simulation will run using CPU. Need little memory.
'GPU'	: the sources are 'back-to-back' mode photon pairs. The phantom and source are voxelized. And, the simulation will run using GPU. 

## PARAMETER
'RES'	: for the simulation of Spatial RESlution phantom.
'SEN'	: for the simulation of SENsitivity.
'SF'	: for the simulation of Scatter Fraction.

## ADDITION EXPERIMENT
'BS'	: for the sinulation of seven Big Spheres.
